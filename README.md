## Project Objective

To simulate, understand, and compare core regression techniques - **Linear (OLS)**, **Ridge**, and **Lasso** - using controlled synthetic datasets, with focus on **model behavior**, **feature selection mechanisms**, and **practical interpretability**.

This comprehensive study progresses from basic linear regression to advanced regularized methods, demonstrating how each technique handles different data scenarios and complexity challenges.

## Why This Matters

In an age where AI dominates headlines, this project revisits what builds long-term value in machine learning: **strong foundations and reproducible models**. Whether tackling marketing mix modeling, credit risk scoring, or churn prediction - regression remains one of the most valuable, interpretable, and effective tools in the ML toolbox.
